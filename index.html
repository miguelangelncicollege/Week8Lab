Using if statements, create a rock, paper, scissors game.

https://wrpsa.com/the-official-rules-of-rock-paper-scissors/

You may use any method of user input and any method of visualisation (alerts, document.getElement etc), 
as you will be marked on the JavaScript logic around your if statements.

When you have completed your game, please commit to GitHub and upload a text document with the link here

the rules to play it are pretty simple.
The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. 
The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:

Rock wins against scissors.
Scissors win against paper.
Paper wins against rock.
